# Sales-Dashboard

## Development
This Sales Dashboard was built in order to understand sales data of a hypothetical fashion company in Australia. The dataset contains sales data with respect to financial year, chain, state, country, manager, category, and sales amount (in dollars). Given this dataset, it came up to my mind the following questions:
1. What is the sales percentage breakdown by chain over the 3-year period ?
2. What are the sales total and trend by state ?
3. What are the categorial component of sales ?
4. Which sales manager is leading and in which state ?

## Structure
The given dataset is in a raw format. However, the overal structure is already in a tabular format. Therefore, i can use *Pivot Table* in Excel to break down the sales data by criteria specified in the above questions. So to use *Pivot Table*, I first put the dataset in data-table format of Excel by pressing CTRL + T. This allows me to build pivot tables taken data from this newly formatted data table. 

I built a total of 8 different pivot tables, one for each graph shown in the dashboard. This is my practice for not mixing up the result if I have to change something in the pivot table. Once I got the pivot tables correctly configured, I chose the appropriate charts to represent the information. I'm not sure if there is a general formula that can be applied when it comes to charting. For me, for example, if I wanted to show sales over time, I would use a line chart. 

## Lesson Learned
Since this is a hypothetical situation of a fashion company in Australia, there is no actual insight to the sales performance. However, during this project, I learned several things:
1. I learned that Sales Dashboard can be made in Excel.
2. I learned that it's really important to have tabular data formatted as data table. This will save a lot of time when there is new data coming in. 
3. I learned to practice having different pivot tables for different graphs. This will help keep track of things.
4. I learned to incorporate slicer in Excel. In my project, Slicer allows me to see the how performance changes when I change the scope of the data fed into the pivot table. 
5. I learned that formating is also very important. Details such as coloring, alignment, presentation can help to communicate information effectively.
